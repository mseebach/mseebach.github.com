    <p>Yesterday, <a href="http://twitter.com/christianevejlo">@christianevejlo</a> tweeted interest in whether
volcano-grounded planes were <a href="http://twitter.com/christianevejlo/status/12346732175">a net benefit for the
environment</a>. Retweeting an answer, <a href="http://twitter.com/christianevejlo/status/12355468953">she referenced</a>
<em>Information is Beautiful</em>’s post <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/2010/planes-or-volcano/">“Planes or Volcano”</a>, an indeed
aesthetically pleasing illustration of the CO2 emissions of the
European aviation industry next to that of the Icelandic volcano. I
replied that <a href="http://twitter.com/mseebach/status/12356337232 (&quot;Information is beautiful seems to be more about beautiful than about information..&quot;)">“Information is beautiful seems to be more about
beautiful than about information..”</a>. She asked me to elaborate,
and here goes..</p>

<p>Infographics seems to have had a renaissance recently. There is a lot
of information out there, and visualizing it in various ways helps
convey this information to a much larger audience. This is a good
thing. <em><a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/">Information is Beautiful</a></em> is part of this, and they have
some <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/2010/who-really-spends-the-most-on-their-military/">truly</a> <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/2010/who-really-spends-the-most-on-their-military/">stunning</a> <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/2010/four-infographical-morsels-no-5/">work</a>. However, in this case, what
was conveyed wasn’t data. It was the point that commercial aviation is
evil bad for the environment. The way I can tell is the way they
casually observe that Eyjafjallajökull belches out 3000 tons of
Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) daily, while they have no interest in this
beyond using it as a stepping stone to estimate the amount of Carbon
Dioxide (CO2) emitted.</p>

<p>CO2 is a greenhouse gas that may very well have some very negative
effects, but they lay decades in the future.</p>

<p>SO2 is what causes acid rain.</p>

<p>Planes emit CO2 - but they emit almost completely clean CO2 (note that
bar global warming, CO2 isn’t considered harmful). Volcanoes blast
tons and tons of all kinds of nasty and not so nasty stuff into the
air. Some of the ash contains nutrients that will fertilize soil,
other will, as mentioned, cause acid rain. It’s much more complex than
CO2.</p>

<p><em>Information is Beautiful</em> could have chosen to diagram the amount of
SO2 emitted by aviation (next to nothing) next to the amount emitted
by the volcano (a lot), but they didn’t — and that’s OK, because it
wouldn’t make sense.</p>

<p>The point is that a volcano compared to commercial aviation is apples
to oranges. No matter how beautiful the infographics, it’s comparison
in itself is pointless.</p>

<p>Now, the general statement that <em>Information is Beautiful</em> is more
about beautiful stems from their previous post — “<a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/2010/how-much-do-music-artists-earn-online/">How much do music
artists earn online?</a>”. Looking at this, again, very good looking
illustration, it’s easy to scroll down and say “boo, evil
Spotify”. But until you look at the numbers (which, in infographics,
is sort-of the point <em>not</em> to), you don’t realize that it compares
apples to oranges.</p>

<p>They equate selling <em>one physical CD</em> with selling <em>one album
download</em> with selling <em>one track download</em> with <em>getting one play</em> on
a service like Spotify. Or the short version: for this graphic to
convey an honest version of the truth, you have to accept the premise
that <em>selling a physical CD and getting a play on Spotify is the
same</em>.</p>

<p>First, one album download should equate ten, not one, track
downloads. And getting a play should acknowledge that a play has zero
marginal cost to the user, and that the user may choose to play a
track many times. Once you’ve purchased and downloaded a track, you’ve
got unlimited plays, forever.</p>

<p>If you accept ten tracks to an album, and ten plays pr. track, the
three bottom circles should be 100 times smaller (and the circles
relating to single track downloads, 10 times smaller). That would make
Rhapsody only twice the low-end retail deal. Considering that
Rhapsody, last.fm and Spotify are widely available to artists, and
retail deals aren’t, that’s not bad at all. Spotify is still on the
cheap end, but only 11 times the low-end retail deal. Considering the
enormous long-tail opportunities that the Spotify-like services
provide (would you buy, say, Rick Astley’s “Never gonna let you down”?
Probably not. Would you play it on Spotify at a party once or twice?
That’s more likely), the number 11 shrinks even more.</p>

<p>And what is probably the worst offense: why doesn’t it compare a
Spotify play with a radio-play? These services are essentially
single-listener-market radio stations.</p>

<p>Again, the agenda is clear. It’s not about the data, it’s about
calling Spotify evil. The data <em>may</em> support that conclusion. The
graphics doesn’t.</p>

<p>Finally, if you want more, please take a look at the <a href="http://informationisbeautiful.bigcartel.com/">limited edition
posters being sold in the right-hand column</a>. Nominally, it’s an
illustration comparing the political left with the political
right. Read closer. The right is said to be “exclusive”, the left
“inclusive”. The left-wing parent is “nurturing” and has a
relationship with her child that is build on “respect and trust”,
while the right-wing parent is “strict” (as opposed to nurturing) and
the relationship is build on “respect and fear”. “Survival of the
fittest” is repeated twice on the right side, the left has “One for
all and all for one”.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that this is how the urban, american left views
itself, I know I’m probably guilty of similar prejudices the other way
around. But if it’s an infographic, it’s about american left-wing
prejudices, not about political philosophies.</p>

<p>In conclusion: Information is Beautiful makes beautiful things. For
information, they are little better than any political blog.</p>

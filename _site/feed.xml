Twitter prompted this essay:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you had a ten million lines, decades-in-the-making fortran code,
how’d you convert it to a modern language, how long would it take, and
how much would it cost?
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/skdh/status/1316570664103563265&quot;&gt;↪&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no short or easy answers to this question. Inevitably, it
depends on a lot of factors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need a perfectly clear understanding of what the program is, what
it’s used for, and by whom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to know what we’re trying to achieve by changing it. If this
is not a clear and significant benefit, and not clearly articulated
and shared by the project team and sponsors, the project will flounder
and ultimately fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to know if the program still works after we’ve changed it.
This sounds basic, but is a surprisingly complex topic, especially for
large, old systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally we need to understand the organisational politics that
will govern our project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s try to unpack some of these questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;domain&quot;&gt;Domain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is this thing even? 10 millions lines of code is a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some systems are figuratively speaking responsible for everything from
the moon landing to the cafeteria menu, an “everything but the kitchen
sink” system. This is especially common in older systems, conceived at
a time when the overhead of building and integrating new systems made
just adding an extra feature to an existing system a very tantalising
proposition, even when (modern) software architecture principles
suggest it should be separate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some systems are figuratively speaking responsible for everything from
the moon landing to the cafeteria menu, an “everything but the kitchen
sink” system
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/share?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; class=&quot;twitter-share-button&quot; data-text=&quot;&amp;ldquo;Some systems are figuratively speaking responsible for everything from the moon landing to the cafeteria menu, an “everything but the kitchen sink” system&amp;rdquo;&amp;#010;&amp;#010;&quot; data-via=&quot;mseebach&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; data-show-count=&quot;false&quot;&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These systems are comparatively easy to reengineer, as we can often
peel off these features in an iterative manner. Indeed, this will
often have happened: We may find that the cafeteria menu module was
last used in 2002 when that particular usage was migrated to another,
new system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the other end of this scale, we find the single, contained model,
responsible for converting a tightly bounded set of inputs into a
similarly tightly bounded set of outputs. It is easier to reason about
a system like this, but the stakes are higher: This system likely
exists because what it does is very important to someone powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conversion-or-the-big-20-rewrite&quot;&gt;Conversion? Or The Big 2.0 Rewrite&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it important to convert this program? Fortran works fine, so
why not keep it in Fortran? Presumably, there are changes that need to
be made, and it’s easier to find programmers in more modern languages.
However, the hardest part of programming isn’t the language, it’s what
we’re trying to do with it. Next to the challenge of understanding
what those millions of lines are doing, learning Fortran will be a
rounding error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could imagine that one of the reasons it’s difficult to make
changes to the existing codebase is that it’s poorly structured.
Getting the structure just right is difficult for the best
programmers, and especially under the pressure of deadlines and other
constraints, shortcuts are often taken. These shortcuts are known as
tech debt, which optimistically suggests the intention to pay it down
in the future. In reality, this is often neglected. These decisions
compound over the years, and in our case, the problem is quite likely
to be exacerbated by the code being written by people who are academic
domain specialists, not expert software engineers. Computers have a
nasty habit of not caring how well engineered software is, only
whether it runs, so “works” trumps “good”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These shortcuts are known as tech debt, which optimistically suggests
the intention to pay it down in the future. In reality, this is often
neglected
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/share?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; class=&quot;twitter-share-button&quot; data-text=&quot;&amp;ldquo;These shortcuts are known as tech debt, which optimistically suggests the intention to pay it down in the future.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mess, much more than the language, is why making changes to the
codebase is so difficult. But untangling it will complicate any
rewriting effort to an even larger degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;things-you-should-never-do&quot;&gt;Things you should never do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would be remiss if I didn’t take the opportunity to link one of the
seminal software engineering blogs here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/&quot;&gt;Joel on Software: Things You
Should Never
Do&lt;/a&gt;.
Spoiler alert: Exactly this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we can do, however, is to progressively develop the program in a
certain direction that allows us to achieve some of the same outcomes.
A favourite text on this process is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Signature/dp/0321503627/&quot;&gt;Growing Object-Oriented Software,
Guided by
Tests&lt;/a&gt;.
Your Fortran program probably isn’t object oriented, but many of the
principles still apply. The idea is to identify and carve out
independent pieces of code, iteratively change and improve the code,
continuously adding smaller and smaller tests as we work through it.
This requires a “ground truth”, which we will return to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason we want to do this, as opposed to starting from a blank
slate, is to enjoy the disciplining constraint of running our code
against a realistic workload (ideally production, depending on the
exact situation) as soon as possible after writing it. Plenty of
issues big and small don’t become apparent until this happens, so
modern software engineering preaches this practice with rather some
zealotry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ground-truth-what-does-good-look-like&quot;&gt;Ground truth: What does good look like?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to test, we need to know what correct looks like across a
wide range of inputs. Assuming the code isn’t well documented and
tested, the fall back plan is to have a substantial corpus of inputs
which we can run through the existing program to provide expected
results for an end-to-end test suite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each segment of the program we want to work on, we run the suite,
recording what goes into the segment and what comes out: This is now
our test suite for the segment, and we can set to work on it in
isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this only works if we can be sure the test suite is fully
representative across the full input domain. Depending on the program,
this can be a very difficult exercise. It seems likely that a very
large part of this code was written to deal with various
idiosyncrasies in the input data – of these, few will be easy to
understand: They will have unstated assumptions, and if we don’t have
input data exhibiting these idiosyncrasies, there are some deep rabbit
holes to crawl down here, trying to understand what’s going on, or if
its even needed anymore.  Remember, if we just blindly copy the
existing logic, we will just be carrying over the complexity, not
achieving the (presumed) goal of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-vetocracy&quot;&gt;The Vetocracy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, but in many ways the most important issue: Assuming we get all
our technical ducks in a row, who will we need to convince to actually
undertake the project? One of the biggest and most underrated
challenges of large software projects in non-software organisations is
to get all the stakeholders aligned . For more sprawling systems, it
can be difficult to even identify these, much less convince them of
the value of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy enough to argue the benefits of a reengineered system, it’s
even comparatively easy to secure a budget for the project. What’s
almost impossible is to get through the vetocracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our rewritten program almost certainly won’t produce the exact same
results, especially if it deals with numerical computation. There will
be minor variations on how floating point numbers are rounded or
truncated and how certain data types are represented. The idiomatic
way to do some things in the target language will be slightly
different from the Fortran way, with results being slightly off in
some decimal, or presented in a slightly different way. How many
people will we need to convince that this is actually OK?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, we will find errors in the Fortran code and want to fix
them. Someone somewhere more powerful than us got their current job on
the basis of a report that (may have) included an incorrect figure due
to the error we found. They will be obliged to go back and report
this, but not before they sucked all the oxygen out of our team for
three months exhausting all possible theoretical reasons that the
error we found is not, in fact, an error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That cafeteria menu subsystem? Because it hasn’t been used for 20
years, nobody knows who owns it. Signing off on its removal is a risk,
punting on the decision isn’t, so expect this decision to get punted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is all before the lawyers get involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons so many of the large and important organisations
running big, old systems don’t set out to do something like this, or
fail miserably if they try, is that they underestimate this dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing this is literally possible, but just barely. In this essay, I’ve
set out some of the minimal groundwork required to even contemplate
such a project: We need clarity on what this program does, why we want
to change it, whether we can provide a compelling argument for the
correctness of our changes and whether the bureaucratic context even
allows us to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What prompted this essay was my observations of how people reacted to government
recommendations and guidelines on how to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. A
very substantial number of people seem to explicitly desire exact instructions
from the government on how to go about their business and they despair when
those instructions are even a little vague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liberalism is the name of a political ideology&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, which ultimately pertains to
the rights and duties of the state and formal power structure. But there is more
to liberalism than political form. Liberalism relies on a personal, moral
commitment. Without liberal people, wishing to live a liberal life, the liberal
political project cannot succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, it is self-evident that when a dangerous disease is circulating in the
population, everybody has a clear, personal duty to take every reasonable
precaution to avoid contracting an infection and to avoid risking passing on
infection. I admit to being slightly shocked at realising this is not broadly
shared, and that large parts of the country could be confused by the change of
the UK government slogan from “Stay home” to “Stay alert”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tweeted at the time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Stay home&quot; is an extrinsic, hierarchical order. On the face of it,
easy to follow, but not really, as the myriad of exceptions show. Even the
police took weeks to settle on mostly-non-enforcement as the only feasible
implementation. 1/
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mseebach/status/1259458778707169280&quot;&gt;↪&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Stay alert&quot; on the other hand is intrinsic. As opposed to the
ostensibly simpler rule, this one literally has zero exceptions, but it's
harder because we have to actually think for ourselves. 2/
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mseebach/status/1259458779822936064&quot;&gt;↪&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The baseline remains &quot;stay at home&quot;. But the exceptions are now
devolved and no longer enumerated entitlements, individual decisions to be
made by considering your specific context and situation and applying reason.
3/ &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mseebach/status/1259458781894914053&quot;&gt;↪&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Will it be abused? Sure, but so was the old rule. The difference is that it
gives licence to responsible, law-abiding citizen who have a reasonable
errand, or even merely a desire they can fulfill responsibly. I.e what
renegades were doing anyway. 4/
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mseebach/status/1259458783010533376&quot;&gt;↪&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hard, simple rules have a time and a place, in narrow, well-understood
contexts. Like traffic. But this isn't it. 5/
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mseebach/status/1259458784201781249&quot;&gt;↪&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It's old news in the business world that intrinsic rules enable better
outcomes than extrinsic ones in complex scenarios: people closer to the
situation has more context and when given freedom, rather than a strict
command, make better decisions. 6/
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mseebach/status/1259458785153818624&quot;&gt;↪&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The flip side of this is that it requires a particular culture, one that
values good outcomes over strict process, one that doesn't punish a failed
good faith effort. The £1m question? Do we have that culture, do we want to
have it, can we get it? 7/
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mseebach/status/1259458786185678850&quot;&gt;↪&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;of-the-people-for-the-people&quot;&gt;Of the People, for the People&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liberals will often worry about the effects of overbearing government policy on
personal attitudes towards independent thought, responsibility, and duty, and
rightly so. But one of the things that turned me off “hard” libertarianism is
the overwhelming focus on government. I believe that as things stand today if we
didn’t have an overbearing state, the first thing people would do would be to
invent one. It would be smaller at first, but it would grow quickly because
there is a deep popular desire to make one’s problems someone else’s. It’s not so much
“Rob Peter to pay Paul”, but rather “Rob Peter and Paul, and absolve them of their
responsibilities in return”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am increasingly convinced that liberal progress does not start with fighting
state power, but by figuring out how to make liberalism a personal, moral value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thicket of laws, regulations and agencies with vague missions and poor
accountability is a product of culture, and lurking just under the surface, that
culture is rooted in a specific demand for the eradication of ambiguity. The
availability of detailed regulations for everything and nothing erodes personal
agency, which further strengthens the demand. At this point, we are through so
many iterations of this cycle that causality is meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not solvable in the formal, political arena. It takes enormous amounts
of political capital to win even modest victories there, and
the feedback to the cycle is weak, so the endeavour becomes Sisyphean. Rather,
we need to encourage a sense of duty to engage directly with issues where they
occur, and this requires being comfortable with complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;freedom-is-complexity&quot;&gt;Freedom is complexity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large government in otherwise free societies don’t generally discourage free
thought, as sometimes suggested by “hard” libertarians, as much as it
discourages complex thought. People desire answers, and government is all too
happy to grows in its attempts to provide them. The result is a society full of
answers, or at least the expectation of them. On COVID-19, the government fell
short; there were no answers to give out. “Stay home” is a clear answer to a
question, and this was correct for a while. “Stay alert” is not an answer, it’s
a prompt to think complex thoughts, and the reaction to the latter betrays a
negative reaction to complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;42 is the answer to life, the universe and everything. The joke works because
these things are obviously vastly complex, and it was folly to even expect an
answer in the first place. This insight has profound impact on modern life that
goes beyond a simple joke, but we seem blind to it. Stability and certainty as
societal terminal values are both deeply reactionary and unpractical: Government
can no more provide and answer to everything than the computer in Hitchhiker’s
Guide to the Galaxy could. Only liberalism provides moral clarity on this
question; socialism and conservatism are united in the expectation that this is
possible, only disagreeing on how to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(End-note: I started drafting this post before the UK face covering mandate was
announced. I have some aesthetic sympathy for the liberal knee-jerk of resiting
being told what to wear and where by the government, and I would have had a
strong preference for a bottom-up emergence of an expectation to wear masks in
shops and on public transportation in favour of a top-down mandate. That said, I
consider resistance to this particular mandate a pointless waste of effort.
Given where we are, as outlined and lamented in this post, it was probably
necessary, and frankly as far as laws go, we can and are doing a lot worse than
masks.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A low-code development platform (LCDP) is software that provides a
development environment used to create application software through
graphical user interfaces and configuration instead of traditional
hand-coded computer programming. A low-code model enables developers
of varied experience levels to create applications using a visual
user interface in combination with model-driven logic
– &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-code_development_platform&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that Real Programming™ is hard, and that
non-programmers should be exposed to it through carefully procured
platforms and interfaces is almost as old as programming itself. COBOL, the
great-grandmother of modern programming languages was conceived as
such a system, the name short for ‘Common Business-Oriented
Language’. While undoubtedly preferable over the alternative at the
time, it did not quite manage to pry programming from the hands of the
programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the age of the mouse and the graphical user interface, the idea
took a new shape that it still broadly embodies: Dragging boxes
around. I particularly recall the software that came with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms&quot;&gt;LEGO
Mindstorms&lt;/a&gt;, a
programmable controller for LEGO that enabled quite advanced
robotics projects. Of course, kids can’t be trusted to operate
keyboards, so the programming interface was a canvas where the user
would drag and drop big, colourful blocks and snap them into each
other. The total irony of the situation was that the blocks were
literally &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; and you had to plug conditions and actions
into them. Of course, on the monitors of the late ’90s, you would run
out of space pretty quickly as well, so anything more complicated than
a switch turning something on and off would overflow the screen, and
you’d have to scroll around, wreaking havoc to any notion of
overview. Luckily, and to LEGOs credit, they allowed multiple
programming environments, so I spend most of my time with Mindstorms
in Visual Studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, XML entered the stage and was immediately
seized on by the no-code-crowd (who, of course, were not called that
yet). Especially in enterprise Java land (from which I hail),
everything was “configurable” in XML –
&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/xsd-configuration.html&quot;&gt;Spring&lt;/a&gt;
was the biggest elephant in that particular china-shop. A Spring XML
configuration file would have you define &lt;em&gt;beans&lt;/em&gt; which are instances
of classes, complete with passing arguments to the constructor in the
form of other beans. This is infinitely flexible, and in theory sounds
pretty good: You can write a program that interacts with eg. a
database, and when running it, your Spring XML would simply
instantiate the particular driver appropriate for your database as a
bean. Now the program can run anywhere without being modified, and
without anticipating all the types of databases it might connect to –
&lt;em&gt;without any programming required&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two things happened: (1) No non-engineer ever edited a Spring XML file
– the examples in the link above should make clear the reason for
this: They are completely incomprehensible to anyone who doesn’t
understand exactly what’s going on. (2) Programmers and architects
totally went to town on this, and configuration files in the thousands
of lines were completely normal. Breaking them was easy, and not being
code, they’re lacking many of the features that would help us find out
where a problem is, such as stack traces and debuggers, and the tools
we would use to avoid the problem in the first place,
like source control and testing. In XML’s defence, it must be said
that this was never the intended role for XML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pattern begins to emerge: These tools may remove &lt;em&gt;code&lt;/em&gt;, but they
don’t remove complexity. Rather, in their attempt to make something
fundamentally complex non-complex, they end up adding significant
amounts of additional complexity instead. The dynamic is similar to
Turing’s insight on computability: Although Spring XML isn’t
Turing-complete, at least not on its own, it is endlessly flexible in
a way that enables you to build incredibly diverse, essentially
unbounded, structures. Once you realise this, you can also begin to
treat your no-code code as code, put it in SCM and write tests around
it. But this, of course, robs no-code of it’s very essence. In the case
of Spring, it is telling that XML configuration files are no longer
the default – actual code is, and the result is often much, much
cleaner, easier to work with and easier to test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No-code efforts can be understood in two very distinct categories:
Those that understand their inherent complexity and those that
don’t. If the complexity is low enough, it can be reduced to simple,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming&quot;&gt;declarative&lt;/a&gt;
configuration. Website creators like Wix are in this category –
you can build a website using a well-built palette of the kinds of
components users expect websites are made up off. But there are things
you can’t do, and there is no way to work around it in a clever
configuration editor. If you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;, it involves building a plugin
using real programming, and there are no apologies made for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the other category, we find the fundamentally patronising idea that
your users can handle infinite, Turing-complete complexity, but is
unable to express this complexity
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming&quot;&gt;imperatively&lt;/a&gt; in text
and must have their hands tied by point-and-click interfaces and
“configuration”. Some of them indeed can’t do this, but that won’t
keep them from trying, and sometimes succeeding, which is terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t believe that the patronisation is necessary: While developers
and product managers fretted over how code would scare people, a
plausible candidate for the most widely used programming language in
the world evolved, hiding in plain sight: Excel. Millions of business
users who had no idea they couldn’t code built software edifices of
awe-inspiring complexity. In the same vein, complex SQL thousands of
lines long are routinely written and edited by business analysts who are
similarly certain that they can’t code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, neither Excel or SQL is a particularly nice language, and
leaving them for only the types of tasks they are designed for should
be strongly encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the conclusion: No-code is a terrible
misunderstanding. Instead, the genuine low-code movement should join
what we might call the max-code movement: modern high-level
programming languages. Python, Ruby, possibly Kotlin (I’m certain
there are other worthy candidates for this list), combined with
modern, wholesome software development practices, such as SCM, testing
and CI. And of course packages and modules: Let the more technically
confident users build components for other users to incorporate. The
success of coding boot camps suggests this is an eminently viable path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of hiding from the complex reality, we must embrace it and
unlock the amazing power of computing for all.&lt;/p&gt;

about hiring and interviewing, most recently in HackerEarth’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://recruiterguide.hackerearth.com/technical-interviews-whats-beyond-the-fizzbuzz-challenge/&quot;&gt;Technical Interviews: What’s beyond the Fizzbuzz challenge&lt;/a&gt;. 
I find points 1-4
solid and insightful advice, but point 5 – the audition project –
irks me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After clearing the hurdles of the interview itself, the candidate is
to be given a small &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; project to be completed in about a week or
so. On the face of it, the idea has a lot going for it: Nobody
disagrees that there are no better ways of evaluation a person’s skill
than their actual performance on solving a real, relevant problem with
the team. But I am rather bearish on the idea:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I plainly don’t think it’s fair to request of a candidate to
invest a whole week into a single application. If they are out of a
job, it’s easier to achieve, but if the person you are hiring already
has a job or is finishing up university, it gets tricky. Most people
in good jobs can probably take a week of vacation on short notice,
what if the offer doesn’t come through?  Then another, and another?
You’re putting yourself in an increasingly exposed position, and
keeping your interviewing secret from your current employer gets all
but impossible. Also, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to interview to
the final stage at two or more potential jobs before making a call. This
practise will make that all but impossible to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, few teams have a cache of such problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem must be well defined and documented and as good as free of
proprietary dependencies -  if we are to get good signal from just a
week’s effort, it can’t be spent on getting to know the intricacies of
your existing codebase or understanding the problem to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean ‘proprietary’ very broadly, not just that
very-closed-source homebaked collection of libraries and middleware
that has grown organically for the past five years that you know you
should get rid off anyway. I mean basically anything that assumes
business or product knowledge beyond what a candidate can reasonably
be expected to learn from your website. Unless your team is working on
a quite popular open source project, that means pretty much all
your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons outsourcing is so difficult is that shared context
is key to effective communication and understanding. The exact same
constraint applies here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’m not thinking hard enough, but I struggle to think of even a
few tasks that fit this bill from my last three jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the real killer is the simple fact that the team needs to work
with this person to evaluate them, and so the team needs to invest
time, effort and emotion into getting to know this person, and suffer the
morale impact of making the no-hire decision – to fire the
person. After all, as a part of your hiring process, you’d want signal
from it: A substantial portion of the candidates should fail at this
stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to make the interview process better, but the audition project is not it.&lt;/p&gt;

UI to manipulate an XML file. My heart sank a bit at the promise of a
trip to the Java/XML enterprise heartland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My original plan was to just implement a minimal, viable subset of the
XML as a proof of concept – and since this is, it self, for a proof
of concept, I might well have gotten away with it. But still, anything
that worth doing is worth doing well, so I did some research (which is
a nice way of saying that I dithered for a while, trying to make up my
mind) and happened to notice that
&lt;a href=&quot;https://jaxb.java.net/tutorial/section_1_3-Hello-World.html&quot;&gt;JAXB&lt;/a&gt;
was already on the classpath of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JAXB – Java Architecture for XML Binding – works by taking a XSD
schema and generating bindings for it. I recalled the similar approach
used in JAX-WS and cringed, but resolved to give it a shot. I have
some previous experience building XSDs and find it a reasonably sane
and helpful exercise: it forces you to consider your XML format
separately. It has some counter-intuitive constraints (an element
can’t contain a mix of element types and children in any order, they
must come in a certain order) but nothing too outrageous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having build the XSD, I fed it to the ‘xjc’ command line util,
helpfully included in the JDK, and got a nicely generated set of
classes with binding to my XML format. The link above is to a “Hello
World” sample, and I don’t think I can improve much on that – thus,
no sample code in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It worked almost as expected –
after battling a bit with the interface to the JAXB unmarshaller, I
discovered that about half the problems I was facing was due to my XSD
not defining a root element. This has the effect of declaring a
universe in which the element can exist, not telling JAXB explicitly
to expect a certain element in my XML file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that fixed, I had a nice and clean typesafe interface to my XML
format that turned out to work exactly as expected. Dynamic languages
have a lot going for them in this domain, but I really like that I
have autocompletion directly into my XML format and if I change the
format, I can re-generate the bindings and get a nice list of compiler
errors to work from.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This week I had to implement a small Java program that would provide a UI to manipulate an XML file.

&lt;p&gt;So, everybody who paid attention in college CS knows this. Heck, I didn’t always pay attention, and I knew it, but it still caught me by surprise when I hit my head on this issue in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recapping the background: The double (as we know it in Java) is short for “double precision binary floating-point format”, and they are the floats more precise big brother. Floats and doubles are a trade-offs where precision is traded for the ability to store them in a fixed amount of space and to perform very fast arithmetic on them. Basically it’s two seperate numbers, called a significant and an exponent, and they are then subjected to some mathemagic to yield any of a very wide range of numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t need the floating point, which most people often don’t, you’re better off storing your numbers as fixed-point (e.g. the DECIMAL columntype in most databases). Unfortunately Java (and many other not-so-modern languages) doesn’t have such a type natively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So doubles aren’t perfectly precise, we know that, but that’s only for large and weird numbers, right? No. For one, a double can’t be 1.2. You wouldn’t know that if you didn’t look for it, because when you print doubles, Java rounds them off for you. And rightly so, the error is exceedingly small: had this been 1.2 meters, the error would amount to a fraction of the size of an atom. Obviously, this is perfectly fine - right up until the point when it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our application dabbles quite a bit in arbitrary precision. We (among other things) deal in sequences of daily return ratios and foreign exchange - numbers that are notoriously unwilling to just be nice and round. By the time we get around to adding up your daily FX-adjusted returns for the past year, the error on a simple double-value starts to add up to real money, so we implement these numbers as BigDecimals (specifically our own wrapper for it that adds some useful fuctionality, including the ability to do fractions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all very well - until someone decides to stick something like 1.2 into BigDecimal. Recalling how printing 1.2 is fine, you’d be excused in assuming that using the double-constructor of BigDecimal is fine. But no, and with potentially disastrous consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider this simple method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;iterate_multiplication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
                                   &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;iterations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                                   &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;multiplicand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bd_out&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ONE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;iterations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++)&lt;/span&gt; 
                  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bd_out&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bd_out&lt;/span&gt;
                           &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ONE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                           &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;multiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;multiplicand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bd_out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And these two invocations – on the surface they are equivalent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;iterate_multiplication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;1.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;iterate_multiplication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;1.2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(BigDecimal will parse a decimal number from a string - IMHO the easiest way to get an exact value into a BigDecimal)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter invocation returns well over 1000 times faster. Three full orders of magnitude. 15 milliseconds in place of 20 seconds. This is because the former is called with an argument that, behind the scene, has 51 decimal places, which, obviously, is significantly more complicated to multiply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two methods returns rather different numbers, but that is due to iterating the multiplication, which amplifies the error of the double. Both numbers have 81 digits before the decimal point, and share the first 13. The really interesting - but at this point, hardly surprising - difference is after the decimal point: The former has 52,000 decimals, the latter just 1,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though fortune-cookie conclusions are often over-generalizing, I will venture into that territory: Don’t ever construct a BigDecimal with a double. It doesn’t do what you think it does.&lt;/p&gt;

European aviation industry next to that of the Icelandic volcano. I

beautiful than about information..”&lt;/a&gt;. She asked me to elaborate,
and here goes..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infographics seems to have had a renaissance recently. There is a lot
of information out there, and visualizing it in various ways helps
convey this information to a much larger audience. This is a good
thing. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/&quot;&gt;Information is Beautiful&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is part of this, and they have
some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/2010/who-really-spends-the-most-on-their-military/&quot;&gt;truly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/2010/who-really-spends-the-most-on-their-military/&quot;&gt;stunning&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/2010/four-infographical-morsels-no-5/&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt;. However, in this case, what
was conveyed wasn’t data. It was the point that commercial aviation is
evil bad for the environment. The way I can tell is the way they
casually observe that Eyjafjallajökull belches out 3000 tons of
Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) daily, while they have no interest in this
beyond using it as a stepping stone to estimate the amount of Carbon
Dioxide (CO2) emitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CO2 is a greenhouse gas that may very well have some very negative
effects, but they lay decades in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SO2 is what causes acid rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planes emit CO2 - but they emit almost completely clean CO2 (note that
bar global warming, CO2 isn’t considered harmful). Volcanoes blast
tons and tons of all kinds of nasty and not so nasty stuff into the
air. Some of the ash contains nutrients that will fertilize soil,
other will, as mentioned, cause acid rain. It’s much more complex than
CO2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Information is Beautiful&lt;/em&gt; could have chosen to diagram the amount of
SO2 emitted by aviation (next to nothing) next to the amount emitted
by the volcano (a lot), but they didn’t — and that’s OK, because it
wouldn’t make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is that a volcano compared to commercial aviation is apples
to oranges. No matter how beautiful the infographics, it’s comparison
in itself is pointless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the general statement that &lt;em&gt;Information is Beautiful&lt;/em&gt; is more
about beautiful stems from their previous post — “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/2010/how-much-do-music-artists-earn-online/&quot;&gt;How much do music
artists earn online?&lt;/a&gt;”. Looking at this, again, very good looking
illustration, it’s easy to scroll down and say “boo, evil
Spotify”. But until you look at the numbers (which, in infographics,
is sort-of the point &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to), you don’t realize that it compares
apples to oranges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They equate selling &lt;em&gt;one physical CD&lt;/em&gt; with selling &lt;em&gt;one album
download&lt;/em&gt; with selling &lt;em&gt;one track download&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;getting one play&lt;/em&gt; on
a service like Spotify. Or the short version: for this graphic to
convey an honest version of the truth, you have to accept the premise
that &lt;em&gt;selling a physical CD and getting a play on Spotify is the
same&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, one album download should equate ten, not one, track
downloads. And getting a play should acknowledge that a play has zero
marginal cost to the user, and that the user may choose to play a
track many times. Once you’ve purchased and downloaded a track, you’ve
got unlimited plays, forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you accept ten tracks to an album, and ten plays pr. track, the
three bottom circles should be 100 times smaller (and the circles
relating to single track downloads, 10 times smaller). That would make
Rhapsody only twice the low-end retail deal. Considering that
Rhapsody, last.fm and Spotify are widely available to artists, and
retail deals aren’t, that’s not bad at all. Spotify is still on the
cheap end, but only 11 times the low-end retail deal. Considering the
enormous long-tail opportunities that the Spotify-like services
provide (would you buy, say, Rick Astley’s “Never gonna let you down”?
Probably not. Would you play it on Spotify at a party once or twice?
That’s more likely), the number 11 shrinks even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what is probably the worst offense: why doesn’t it compare a
Spotify play with a radio-play? These services are essentially
single-listener-market radio stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the agenda is clear. It’s not about the data, it’s about
calling Spotify evil. The data &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; support that conclusion. The
graphics doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you want more, please take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://informationisbeautiful.bigcartel.com/&quot;&gt;limited edition
posters being sold in the right-hand column&lt;/a&gt;. Nominally, it’s an
illustration comparing the political left with the political
right. Read closer. The right is said to be “exclusive”, the left
“inclusive”. The left-wing parent is “nurturing” and has a
relationship with her child that is build on “respect and trust”,
while the right-wing parent is “strict” (as opposed to nurturing) and
the relationship is build on “respect and fear”. “Survival of the
fittest” is repeated twice on the right side, the left has “One for
all and all for one”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no doubt that this is how the urban, american left views
itself, I know I’m probably guilty of similar prejudices the other way
around. But if it’s an infographic, it’s about american left-wing
prejudices, not about political philosophies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion: Information is Beautiful makes beautiful things. For
information, they are little better than any political blog.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Yesterday, @christianevejlo tweeted interest in whether volcano-grounded planes were a net benefit for the environment.

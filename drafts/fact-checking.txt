Fact-checking: Mostly false

- two kinds of facts: clear, objective ones and "balance of evidence"
- belief: not even balance of evidence, somebody is entitled to a belief (possibly as long as it doesn't contradict clear objective facts?)
  --- flat earth: interesting exercise in epistomology, a steel man view of the position is that it's actually kind-of difficult for individuals to learn from first principles that the earth is not flat, we have to take a lot of information on little more than faith

- also difficult: parsing a quote down to falsifiable statements, itself fraught: you often have to make small decisions about what the subject intended in order to "check" it.

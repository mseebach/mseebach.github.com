title: About that audition project
---

The idea of an audition project comes up frequently in recommendations
about hiring and interviewing, most recently in HackerEarth's [Technical Interviews: Whatâ€™s beyond the Fizzbuzz challenge][1]. 
I find points 1-4
solid and insightful advice, but point 5 -- the audition project --
irks me.

After clearing the hurdles of the interview itself, the candidate is
to be given a small *real* project to be completed in about a week or
so. On the face of it, the idea has a lot going for it: Nobody
disagrees that there are no better ways of evaluation a person's skill
than their actual performance on solving a real, relevant problem with
the team. But I am rather bearish on the idea:

First, I plainly don't think it's fair to request of a candidate to
invest a whole week into a single application. If they are out of a
job, it's easier to achieve, but if the person you are hiring already
has a job or is finishing up university, it gets tricky. Most people
in good jobs can probably take a week of vacation on short notice,
what if the offer doesn't come through?  Then another, and another?
You're putting yourself in an increasingly exposed position, and
keeping your interviewing secret from your current employer gets all
but impossible. Also, I don't think it's unreasonable to interview to
the final stage at two or more potential jobs before making a call. This
practise will make that all but impossible to achieve.

Second, few teams have a cache of such problems.

The problem must be well defined and documented and as good as free of
proprietary dependencies -  if we are to get good signal from just a
week's effort, it can't be spent on getting to know the intricacies of
your existing codebase or understanding the problem to begin with.

I mean 'proprietary' very broadly, not just that
very-closed-source homebaked collection of libraries and middleware
that has grown organically for the past five years that you know you
should get rid off anyway. I mean basically anything that assumes
business or product knowledge beyond what a candidate can reasonably
be expected to learn from your website. Unless your team is working on
a quite popular open source project, that means pretty much all
your code.

One of the reasons outsourcing is so difficult is that shared context
is key to effective communication and understanding. The exact same
constraint applies here. 

Maybe I'm not thinking hard enough, but I struggle to think of even a
few tasks that fit this bill from my last three jobs.

Finally, the real killer is the simple fact that the team needs to work
with this person to evaluate them, and so the team needs to invest
time, effort and emotion into getting to know this person, and suffer the
morale impact of making the no-hire decision -- to fire the
person. After all, as a part of your hiring process, you'd want signal
from it: A substantial portion of the candidates should fail at this
stage.

We need to make the interview process better, but the audition project is not it.
